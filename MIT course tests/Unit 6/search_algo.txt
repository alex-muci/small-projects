Searching algorithm:
1. brute: linear
2. bisection search (but list must be sorted):
   O(n log n) with recursion (n cost is for copying the list), O(log n) keeping track of the list (no copies)


In computer programming, indirection (also called dereferencing) is the ability to reference something using a name,
reference, or container instead of the value itself. The most common form of indirection is the act of
manipulating a value through its memory address. For example, accessing a variable through the use of a pointer.

Example 1
def search1(L, e):
    for i in range(len(L)):
        if L[i] == e:
            return True
        if L[i] > e:
            return False
    return False

Example 2
def search2(L, e):
    for i in L:
        if i == e:
            return True
        elif i > e:
            return False
    return False

Example 3
def search3(L, e):
    if L[0] == e:
        return True
    elif L[0] > e:
        return False
    else:
        return search3(L[1:], e)


NB:
- search and search2 return the same answers, but
- search and search3 return the same answers provided L is non-empty and e is in L
  if empty search3 throws an error, also if e is not in L it will go to the case where L is empty
